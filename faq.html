                          Subject tests are 60-minute tests administered by the College Board at your testing center. They are on one topic and a great way to demonstrate proficiency in one subject. Some schools require subject tests in your program of interest. Research your college to find out those requirements. <br> <br>
                          For information about fee waivers for SAT Subject Tests, speak to your guidance counselor or visit <a href ="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/applying-101/college-application-fee-waivers"> this site. </a>

                        Every college and university will have something called the Net Price Calculator on their website. Before you apply to a school, go on to their website and find this calculator. You will be prompted to enter basic tax and income information and it will output your expected family contribution, or EFC. <br>
                        The FAFSA or Free Application for Federal Student Aid will take this same information and alert you to what assistance is available to you and your family. <br><br>
                        An example of a Net Price calculator can be found <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/net-price-calculator"> here</a> and the FASFA website is <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa"> here. </a>

                          It does not matter. Colleges would like to see that you took the most challenging courses for you. If those are IB courses, that's awesome. If those are AP courses, dope! <br>
                          You are judged against people from your school in most cases, not people in different districts and with different opportunities.

                            <a name="eaanded"></a>
                            <article class="message is-primary">

                                There are three different types of application cycles: regular decision, rolling, and early programs.<br><br>
                                With rolling decisions, you will find out the decision made on your application within a few weeks of submitting your application. The benefit of this is that you will have the decision on your application sooner rather than later. However, this also means that the later you submit an application, the chances of acceptance are lower. <br><br>
                                With early programs, there are two main categories. Early action is nonbinding - meaning you are not obligated to attend if you are accepted - and you will recieve your decision in around January or December. Early action is generally binding - meaning you will be required to go. However, for both of these, the application deadline is around Early November.<br><br>
                                Regular decision means you will likely not turn in your application until January 1st. You will recieve a decision sometime in the Spring but you are not obligated to attend the university.

                                  Anything. Write about anything that matters to you. Are you really passionate about sketch comedy? Write about it. Do you enjoy birdwatching? Write about it. The goal is that anyone who knows you can read your essay without your name on it and know who wrote it. <br><br>
                                  Just avoid writing an essay about something because you think "[X] school will love this essay" or "this essay makes me sound like  real student at [X]." Write about yourself because as much as this process is you applying for a school, the schools are looking for people who would be a good fit with the student body.
