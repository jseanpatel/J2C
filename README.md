## Description

J2C is a web tool for organizing and understanding the college application process - which was made during Google CSSI 2019 in Kirkland, Washington. The user simply selects any application topics of their choosing, and information is curated. Then, after a sign-in, any deadlines from these topics are added to their Google Calendar.

## Technologies

* Google Calendar API
* Font Awesome 5
* Bulma

## Acknowledgements
